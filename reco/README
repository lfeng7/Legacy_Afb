Take selected root files and do top pair reconstruction
# top_reco.py
Do reconstruction. Output is *_reco.root
condorjobs is the grid run dir for top_reco.py
# makeAngles.py
Calculate cos_theta* from reco p4 of top pairs. Input is *_reco.root. Output *_angle.root
to run, do :
./run_makeAngles_sideband.sh for sideband
./run_makeAngles_signal.sh for signal
Need to edit the .sh file with the correct reco file path
Remember to name signal reco file start with 'TT' so the code knows it is signal MC

# aux plotting scripts:
# reco_stacker.py
Plotter of cos_theta*,mtt and xf. Input is *_angle.root
# stack_angles.sh
Plot MC/data comparison of model vars and some reconstructed vars, ie, reco_mass_thad

# to-do list for future improvement
Merge reco and cs angle calculation and template formatting into a single step for convinience
