This is the codes that select events from PAT-Tuple, making ttree, and plot control plots
V 2.2
selection.py
Do most of event selections, make cut flow hists, and keep reco and gen objects of selected events in ttree, 'selected'.
condorjobs dir has everything needed to run selection on condor.
condorjobs_fakelep is for fakelep templates study and making.

stacker.py do two things
(1) Take selected ttree, make histograms of control plots, and calculate most of the MC correction SFs for MC.
(2) Make stack plots of MC and compare with data

What's added in 2.X version:
(0) workflow overhaul. Now selection/treemaker is a separate step as plotting/stacking. 
(1) b-tagging, electron ID/Isolation efficiency, HLT trigger efficiency, PU, top pT reweighting, correction SFs are implemented
(2) Nicer plotting, with Data/MC comparison plots added
(3) selection.py now can make side-band selection, but only newer version of jhu ntuples will work because fake lep is from PFLooseEles
(4) stacker also add options for fakelep. Some extra cuts can be done in fakelep mode, such as additonal b-tagging and ele iso cuts.

1/2017
changed selection.py
(1) Add another way to find initial partons, based on number of top dau, so mc@NLO can work now
(2) Add gen_w into selected files, which is specifically for mc@NLO. For all other sample, w = 1
(3) Attemped to add JEC for JES and JER scale, copied snippets from Nick. Have not verified yet.
