This is the codes that select events from PAT-Tuple, making ttree, and plot control plots
V 2.2
selection.py
Do most of event selections, make cut flow hists, and keep reco and gen objects of selected events in ttree, 'selected'.
condorjobs dir has everything needed to run selection on condor.
condorjobs_fakelep is for fakelep templates study and making.

stacker.py do two things
(1) Take selected ttree, make histograms of control plots, and calculate most of the MC correction SFs for MC.
(2) Make stack plots of MC and compare with data

What's added in this version:
(1) selection.py now can make side-band selection, but only newer version of jhu ntuples will work because fake lep is from PFLooseEles
(2) stacker also add options for fakelep. Some extra cuts can be done in fakelep mode, such as additonal b-tagging and ele iso cuts.
